# Angular-assignment

In this assignment which is given by Sapient company to me as a first round of interview, I have fetch the data to show from API. 
I have also made the UI which was provided by the company. In this the UI approach taken was Mobile First, which means we have to make the HTML and CSS according to mobile devices first then go up to bigger devices. 
As a UI developer I was not able to perform the Filter Functionality. The UI is custom made without any use of framework such as bootstrap and it is fully responsive on tablets, laptops & mobiles.
